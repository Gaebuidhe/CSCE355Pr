Name:
  Deterministic Finite Automata - CSCE 355 Project

Description:
  This is a project whose main goal was to apply aspects of Deterministic Finite
  Automata (DFA) to code. Accomplished in this project were the 'Simulating a
  DFA' and 'Determining properties of a DFA' from the programming assignment.
  The code in this project utilizes Python 2; running the programs will be
  described below.

  Simulating a DFA:
    Simulating a DFA reads lines from two text files (the DFA and a set of test
    strings) and outputs 'accept' or 'reject' based on each test string from the
    text file containing the string. Necessary files to run this function are
    dfa.py, and simDFA.py in the same folder. Running the program uses command
    python2 simDFA.py [dfa].txt [test_strings].txt. The command does accept
    pathway directions.

    Required files:
      * dfa.py
      * simDFA.py

    Example of Commandline input:
      * python2 simDFA.py simDFA.txt simDFA_stringTest.txt
      * python2 simDFA.py ./test-cases/simulator/bigDFA.txt ./test-cases/simulator/bigDFA-strings.txt

  Determining properties of a DFA:
    Determining properties of a DFA utilizes depth first search algorithms to
    determine paths from the start state to see if a final state can be reached.
    From there, the program continues to determine if there are cycles in the
    system. If there is but the start state cannot reach
